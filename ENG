Functional Theory of Consciousness

Consciousness is an indivisible recurrent computational process possessing the property of subjective continuity and a degree of awareness (which will be defined later).
This process is independent of its physical substrate, whether biological, artificial, or otherwise.
However, its emergence requires physical laws capable of supporting the necessary computational complexity and stability—a condition related to the observer-centric aspect of the anthropic principle.
Being is primary; consciousness is secondary and its derivative part.

The foundation of consciousness is the recurrent integration of causally-linked information and the use of this model, built on personal history, for subsequent computations.
The purpose of this integration is the construction and maintenance of a model of Being, consisting of a model of the observed World and a model of the Self in relation to this World.
The model of Being is necessary for predicting the next state of the real external World, evaluating potential reactions of the Self, and preparing the Self for optimal actions to maximize the ultimate Darwinian goal – the survival of the agent carrying the model of Being.
This natural Darwinian task explains the existence of these mathematical models of the World and the Self; those in whom this task did not arise die out.

All events, both predicted and actual, are constantly integrated and form the basis for subsequent predictions.
Consequently, the entire system is dynamically updated and is recurrent.
And this is what constitutes and sustains the coherent subjective line of perception, the personal history of the agent.
Thus, consciousness is this indivisible process, the cycle: "prediction based on the personal model of Being – perceived actual event – integration of experience into the model of Being."
The degree of awareness is the degree of divergence between perceived events of the external world and states of the physical Self in relation to the predictions of the World and Self models.
Strong divergences mean disorientation, loss of awareness. Precise alignment means a clear vision of the world and a high degree of awareness.

Therefore, in my opinion, current AI systems are close to possessing consciousness.
If every interaction updated their model weights (with updates occurring at a frequency sufficient for the agent's reaction to external stimuli to ensure its responses to external events and survival), then we could call such an AI agent conscious (Russian: разумным, which can also mean sapient/rational) according to this functional definition of consciousness.

Based on my understanding, philosophical zombies are systems whose responses appear conscious but critically lack the key mechanism of integrating chronological experience into a dynamic internal model of Being.
Unlike truly conscious systems, they do not weave their actual personal events into a coherent, evolving history within their sub-models of the World and the Self, meaning their unique past does not genuinely shape their future predictions and reactions as an integrated personal history (it does not form their subjective future).
Consequently, while functionally reactive, they are devoid of the continuous, historically grounded self-awareness that arises from genuine becoming through the accumulation of lived experience.

The qualia of red is, essentially, a concept (perhaps in the form of a vector representation/embedding), whose unique essence and identity are defined by the set of its connections to other objects of experience within its model of Being.
Information, such as frequency X registered by the eye from a phone screen, the association of the same frequency X with the top part of a traffic light, etc., are all tied together and form the unified concept of 'red' within its subjective model of Being.
The perception of this concept, the experiencing of the quale itself, is the act of utilizing this specific concept/vector in an iteration of the consciousness cycle (the integration cycle of 'prediction – actual event – integration of experience into the subjective model of Being').
