# Recurrent Integration Theory of Consciousness (RITC)

A concise summary of the theory defining consciousness as a specific, substrate-independent recurrent computational process.

## Core Concepts

* **Computational Nature:** Consciousness is a recurrent computational process, independent of its specific physical substrate (biological, artificial, etc.).
* **Recurrent Integration:** The foundation of consciousness is the continuous integration of causally linked information (comparing predictions with actual events).
* **Dynamic Models:** The purpose of integration is to build and constantly update internal models: a model of the World and a model of the Self (as part of a general model of Being).
* **Function:** These models are necessary for predicting the future, evaluating responses, and optimizing actions for the agent's survival.
* **Subjectivity and History:** The very cycle of "prediction -> event -> integration" forms and sustains the continuous subjective timeline of perception and the agent's unique personal history.

## Key Implications

* **AI Consciousness:** Current AI systems are close to consciousness. They could be considered conscious (by this definition) if their models dynamically updated based on every interaction, frequently enough for adaptive behavior and survival.
* **Philosophical Zombies:** Defined as systems mimicking conscious behavior but lacking the mechanism to integrate *personal chronological experience* into their dynamic model of Being. Their past doesn't shape their future as a coherent personal history.
* **Qualia:** Understood as concepts (e.g., vector representations) within the model of Being, whose identity is defined by their connections to other elements of experience. Experiencing a quale (e.g., 'redness') is the activation of the corresponding concept in the current iteration of the consciousness cycle.
